# Tutor App

Mostly here to revisit Swift. 

ToDo:
* TODOs
* Seems to be generating long gaps - and negative gaps with the full data set. 
* Able to start from a fresh bundle - without history
* Loads from file twice when running tests.
* Scores and stats in another tab
* Other question sets e.g. coding, my shorthand (requires pictures)
* There's a pause when it is looking for the next question to ask. 
* The first time it asks a question it will immediately ask it again
