# Tutor App

Mostly here to revisit Swift. 

ToDo:
* TODOs
* Remove references to gapHistory which is not sufficient to the task and has been replaced with history.
* Seems to be generating long gaps
* Able to start from a fresh bundle - without history
* Scores and stats in another tab
* Other question sets e.g. coding, my shorthand (requires pictures)
